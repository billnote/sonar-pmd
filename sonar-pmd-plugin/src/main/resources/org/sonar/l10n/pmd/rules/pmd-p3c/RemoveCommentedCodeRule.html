Note: Remove obsoleted codes or configuration in time to avoid code redundancy.

<p>Look for qualified this usages in the same class.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
 public static void hello() {
    /// Business is stopped temporarily by the owner.
    // Business business = new Business();
    // business.active();
    System.out.println("it's finished");
 }
</pre>
