Note: In order to remind the consumer of explicit assignments, there are no initial values for members in a POJO class. As a consumer, you should check problems such as NullPointerException and warehouse entries for yourself.

<p>Look for qualified this usages in the same class.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
    public class DemoDO {
        String str;
        Integer a;
    }
</pre>
