Note: Consider this assignment: Integer var = ?. When it fits the range from -128 to 127, we can use == directly for a comparison. Because the Integer object will be generated by IntegerCache.cache, which reuses an existing object. Nevertheless, when it fits the complementary set of the former range, the Integer object will be allocated in Heap, which does not reuse an existing object. This is a pitfall. Hence the equals method is recommended.

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
    Integer a = 235;
    Integer b = 235;
    if (a.equals(b)) {
        // code
    }
</pre>
