Note: The negation operator is not easy to be quickly understood. There must be a positive way to represent the same logic.

Negative example:
    // Use `if (!(x >= 628))` to represent that x is less than 628.
    if (!(x >= 628)) {
        // ...
    }

Positive example:
    // Use `if (x < 628)` to represent that x is less than 628.
    if (x < 628)) {
        // ...
    }
