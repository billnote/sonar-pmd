'L' instead of 'l' should be used for long or Long variable because 'l' is easily to be regarded as number 1 in mistake.

<p>Look for qualified this usages in the same class.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre>
    Negative example:
    //It is hard to tell whether it is number 11 or Long 1.
    Long warn = 1l;

    Positive example:
    Long notwarn = 1L;
</pre>
